# typerdrive-tutorial

_A demonstration project showing how to use typerdrive_


## Installing

I recommend using [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) to install and run project.

```
uv sync
```


## Running

There are two separate apps in this project.

To run the API that the CLI connects to, run:


```
uv run fastapi dev src/typerdrive_tutorial/api.py
```

To run the CLI, run:

```
uv run typerdrive-tutorial
```
